#FairDistribution

Fairness is achieved by distributing the prizes so that each winner gets a sum as close to the average as possible.

Criteria:
=============

1.Order the winners
2.For each winner, assign them the current highest available prize; so using your first example, winner one gets 1000, winner two gets 800, winner three gets 500.
3.If there are still prizes to allocate,  get the winner with the least prize total and assign them the current highest available prize; so winner three gets 400, winner two gets 200
4.Repeat step three until all prizes are allocated; so winne three gets 100
